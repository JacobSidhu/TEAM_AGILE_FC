Persona: Mark

Background:

Age: 19

Education: Freshman student studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Central Lancashire

Color-Blind Type: Protanopia (Red-Green Color Blindness)

Location: Suburban area

Goals and Motivations:

Accessible Learning: Seeks educational platforms that accommodate color-blindness to enhance learning experiences.

Efficient Studies: Aims for interfaces allowing easy comprehension of color-coded information in his course materials.

Challenges:

Color Interpretation: Faces difficulty discerning between certain shades of red and green, especially in engineering diagrams or graphs.

Information Accessibility: Struggles when crucial information is solely conveyed via color-coding in lectures or textbooks.

Graph Misinterpretation: Sometimes misinterprets charts or graphs with color-based distinctions, affecting study comprehension.

Preferences:

Contrast-Friendly Design: Prefers interfaces with high contrast and clear labels or patterns for better differentiation.

Symbolic Indicators: Values symbols or text alongside color-based information in engineering diagrams or schematics.

Color-Blind Mode: Appreciates platforms offering a color-blind mode for better visibility in course materials.

Behaviors:

Prioritizing Accessibility: Chooses educational platforms or apps with inclusive designs, particularly in engineering-specific software.

Adaptive Strategies: Utilizes browser extensions or settings that enhance color visibility for his studies.

Quotes/Anecdotes:

"Clear contrasts and additional labels in engineering diagrams make understanding course materials much easier for me."

"Having a color-blind mode not only benefits my studies but supports inclusivity for everyone studying similar courses."

Considerations for Mark's Educational Experience:

Designing for Accessibility in Engineering Materials: Implementing high contrast, clear labels, and symbols alongside colors in diagrams or schematics.

Alternative Indicators in Engineering Courses: Including text or symbols alongside color-coded information for better comprehension in engineering-specific content.

Involvement in Usability Testing: Involving color-blind students, especially those studying technical courses, in testing to ensure interface clarity and accessibility in engineering-related educational tools.
